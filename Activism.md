### Passion

The etymology of the term passion can be traced back both to the perfect participle of the Latin verb *pati, passus*, which literally means *suffered*, and to the Greek πάθος *(pathos)* which indicates suffering as well as strong emotion.
Passion therefore indicates both a moment of deep suffering and a desire, a transport of the soul opposed to λόγος *(logos)*.

## Passion as the fuel of Activism 

Activism is often flawed; besides ***Passion**, it requires commitment, skills, knowledge and resources to achieve systemic change goals*.      

The risk is to fight against current exploitative development models in a form that is ineffective in the long term; e pursue battles in a piecemeal way, dissipate energies and end up practising the same talking to whom we are referr as ineffective.

To build a solid professional capacity structure is mandatory to open up our horizons, understand our role in the community and what goals we want to achieve to generate consistent change. Diverse skills are involved beyond hard work and good organisation, such as communication mecanism and agreed values.

Perhaps it's just to tackle those precious entities called Passions, and deal with them.
