S. Pinkers book on Rationality's [review](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/hot-thought/202110/steven-pinker-rationality).
Why a book on rationality now? With the world's steady progress towards verifiable rationality since the Enlightenment, we now resort to our emotions and feelings rather than our ability to reason. Using Google to analyse language use from 1850 to 2019, the researchers found that the use of words associated with rationality such as 'conclusion' and 'determine' increased after 1850, while emotionally charged terms such as 'believe' and 'feel' decreased. This trend existed both in fiction and non-fiction books and in the popular press. Since the 1980s and our so-called 'post-truth era', usage has started to change. Emotionally charged words have increased, in parallel with the shift from collectivist to individualist language and from rationality to feeling. <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

Historian Yuval Noah Hariri, argues that liberal humanism has shifted from the individual as the source of truth to feelings as the centre of all truth. in post-modernism, truth and virtue are seen as power structures exercised by the economic and social elite. When individual feelings take precedence over other forms of knowledge - expertise, science, rationality and religious faith - 'my truth' becomes the source of knowledge. All issues must be decided through the lens of relativism and subjectivity; in other words, rationality declines and retreats to the dusty shelf.
