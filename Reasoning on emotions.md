# Reason and Emotions

## Notes

*Memory is sometimes a trap, the true story is far more objective* 

Historian Yuval Noah Harari, argues that *liberal humanism has shifted from the **individual** as the source of truth to **feelings** as the centre of all truth*. When individual feelings take precedence over other forms of knowledge - expertise, science, rationality and religious faith - **'my truth' becomes the source of knowledge** and all issues go through the lens of relativism and subjectivity.

S. Pinkers book on Rationality's [review](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/hot-thought/202110/steven-pinker-rationality).
The world's steady progress towards verifiable rationality since the Enlightenment had a slightly halt with us now resort to our emotions and feelings rather than our ability to reason.  
Researchers found, using Google to analyse language use from 1850 to 2019, an increasing of words associated with rationality such as 'conclusion' and 'determine' after 1850, while emotionally charged terms such as 'believe' and 'feel' decreased. A trend showing both in fiction and non-fiction books and in popular press. Since the 1980s, *in our so-called 'post-truth era', usage has started to change and emotionally charged words have increased, in parallel with the **shift from collectivist to individualist language** and from rationality to feeling*. <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

Postulating that Feeling is knowledge that moves directly, empathically, and Critical Thinking is about skills and analytical abilities, **we hold the view that both are part of the knowledge process as complementary.**
