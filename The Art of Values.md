Through the Theory of Values we want to develop a method that uses language to model concepts and build shared spaces, we call it Art to underline the practice that envelops the theory. 

Art expresses sensibility, and at the same time requires planning, in every artistic technique there is therefore a process of practical reasoning, through which we assume we can operate.
