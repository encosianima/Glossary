**Common**, adjective, means mutual, shared by more than one.

*Derived terms*:    
**Commons**, noun, is the abstract concept of resources shared by more than one, for example air, water, information.      
**Common Good** which comes to be used in many ways, though we might summarise it as follows: 
* It's *substantive* when it is shared and beneficial to all or most of the members of a given community; it is a good being enjoyed in common.
* It's *procedural* when the good is an outcome achieved through collective participation and by shaping a shared will.     
Both are based on respect for the dignity and rights of others.  

**The Tragedy of the Commons** is when one (or more part)s refuse to make sacrifices of their interests for the **Common Good** in a context not regulated by shared social structures or formal rules.                 
**Digital Commons**; refers to information and data.       
**The Tragedy of Digital Commons**; apllies to Hardin's theory to Digital Commons.
