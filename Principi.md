### Notes

* Deconstructing for constructive purposes, focus on research for a coherent critique of reality.


* Humans beings inhabit language, and healthy communication is mandatory.


* Participation is respecting others not imposing but building narratives together.


* Keep the direction outwards and not towards ourselves.


* Conflicts are inevitable, their management involves transformation as a tool.
