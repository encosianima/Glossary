*To take someone by the chin and force her to listen to things such as: - swear that you believe in the proletarian struggle, SWEAR! Otherwise, I will never be able to look at you.*

Do not swear, do not say anything except "leave me", but keep in mind there's a long walk to defeat that monster; 

Human beings have powerful defence mechanisms and no one likes to be the victim but neither does anyone like to be the monster, so the roles can paradoxically be mixed, fed by distinct versions of the same truth in favour of the justification in which the defence mechanism makes us live.

The reasons for good and evil are complex, to err is human and to forgive oneself is the path for those who set out on a personal path, otherwise paved with unhealthy selfishness.
