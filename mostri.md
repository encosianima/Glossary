to take someone by the chin and force her to listen to things such as: - *swear that you believe in the proletarian struggle, SWEAR! Otherwise, I will never be able to look at you.*

We human beings have powerful defence mechanisms; no one likes to be the victim but neither does anyone like to be the monster, so the roles mixed up, fed by distinct versions of the same truth, satisfied with the justification in which a defence mechanism makes us live.

The reasons for good and evil are complex, to err is human but it is also an experience to be lived as such, first forgiving oneself (perhaps the most difficult part) and then asking for forgiveness. This process allows us to embark on a personal journey of respectful coexistence with others, otherwise paved with unhealthy selfishness.

Do do not swear won't keep the walk to defeat that monster shorter.

Mosters are real as well as projected, our daunting task to discerne.
